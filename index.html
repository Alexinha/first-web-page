  <img src="lana-del-rey-at-grammy.jpeg" alt="Lana Del Rey">: the source tag can be followed by either the URL from the webiste
  or simply by name of the pic file when it's in the same folder as the index.html.
  if you want to make another folder just for the images, see example below.
  the good thing about using pic from a local folder is that you can modifiy the pic's size and everything first.
  And webiste referred to could be shut down in the future.
  the "alt" is used to leave keywords for google to search ur pic.-->

  <!--this is how path works the same: <img src="images\blue banisters.jpeg" alt="blue banisters">
  but mind that the image folder should be at the same layer with html file.
  Also the pics are placed next to each other from left to right, instead of vertically.-->

      <!--p for pharagraph. compare <em> and <i>, as well as <strong> and <b>,

      Alexinha is blessed with a curious mind and exceptional talents on multipule subjects. <br>
      She likes sun bathing, cooking and mopping the floor when she needs to relax.<br>
      She also likes coffee, but she thinks Americano tastes like chinese herb medicine.

    <!--when switch to a new paragraph we use another pair of <p>,
      if using <br />, there won't be space between two paragraphs obv.-->
    <hr />
    <!--so apparently here you can type a self-closing tag by either type 'hr' + return and it will show up as how it is,
      or type '<' and then 'hr', which will give you a hr with a '/',
      the difference seems to be the one with a slash will be compatible with XHTML as well, so it's portable.-->

      If I want to align them together I might need to use CSS so leave this to later.
